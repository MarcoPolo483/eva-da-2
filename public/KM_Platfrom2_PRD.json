This tab has not been reviewed or edited for content, format etc. Only highlighting these potential issues as a courtesy. All NFRs that reference external policy guidelines seem to be contractual. Referencing an external policy isn't really a functional requirement or a non-functional requirement. \n\nDefinitions of FR and NFR FYI: \n\nFunctional requirements describe the capabilities that a solution must have in terms of the behaviour and information that the solution will manage. They answer the question, “what does the solution need to do?” Functional requirements must not specify how the solution should be designed to perform these functions.\n\nNon-Functional requirements do not relate directly to the behaviour or functionality of the solution, but rather describe conditions under which a solution must remain effective or qualities that a solution must have. The failure to identify non-functional requirements can result in a solution that is not fit for purpose because it takes too long, is too difficult to use or cannot operate under required conditions."
